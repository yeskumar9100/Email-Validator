# Email Validator 📨

This is my first Python mini project — an **Email Validator**.  
It checks whether an email address is valid based on a set of rules such as:

- Presence of a single "@" symbol
- Proper format of local and domain parts
- Appropriate length of each section
- General structure of the email

## 🔧 Technologies Used
- Python 3
- Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`)

## 📁 File
- `email_validator.ipynb` — the main Jupyter Notebook containing the validation logic and test cases.

## 🚀 How It Works
The script takes an email address input and checks:
- If it contains exactly one "@"
- If the local and domain parts meet length requirements
- If the domain contains a valid structure (like `.com`, `.org`, etc.)

Example checks in the code help demonstrate valid and invalid email addresses.

## 🧠 What I Learned
Through this project, I got hands-on experience with:
- String operations in Python
- Writing clean and readable functions
- Using conditional logic to perform validation
- Working with Jupyter Notebook

## 📌 Future Improvements
- Add regex-based validation
- Implement a GUI using Tkinter
- Deploy as a web app
